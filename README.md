# Report Intermittent Fails
Open Github Issues for intermittently failing tests.  Inspired by [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/blog/track-flaky-specs-automatically/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'report_intermittent_fails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install report_intermittent_fails

## Usage

TODO: work out how this gets used ...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
